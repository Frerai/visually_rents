"# visually_rents" 
This is a simple attempt at creating an application using Django framework, and can be viewed at:

https://visually-rents.herokuapp.com/movies/ 

This application depicts a movie rental system, and has a few modest features built. I might apply more features in the future.
Please feel free to provice any feedback - I would appreciate it.
Thank you very much!
